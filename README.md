This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "Generation of Diverse Biological Forms through Combinatorial Interactions between Tissue Polarity and Growth", by Richard Kennaway, Enrico Coen, Amelia Green, and Andrew Bangham (2011), appearing in PLoS Comput Biol 7(6): [e1002071](doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002071).

The models are in the folders:

GPT\_CASE\_A  GPT\_CASE\_B  GPT\_CASE\_C  GPT\_CASE\_E  GPT\_CASE\_RST  GPT\_CASES\_FGHI  GPT\_CASES\_JKLM  GPT\_CASES\_NOPQ  GPT\_InvagEmbryo

The models can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
